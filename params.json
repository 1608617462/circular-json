Here an example:\r\n\r\n```JavaScript\r\n// a logged object with circular references\r\n{\r\n  \"circularRef\": \"[Circular]\",\r\n  \"list\": [\r\n    \"[Circular]\",\r\n    \"[Circular]\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n// what do we do with above output ?\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust type this in your `node` console: `var o = {}; o.a = o; console.log(o);`. The output will be `{ a: [Circular] }` ... good, but that ain't really solving the problem.\r\n\r\nHowever, if that's all you need, the function used to create that kind of output is probably faster than `CircularJSON` and surely fits in less lines of code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why Not {{put random name}} Solution\r\nSo here the thing: circular references can be wrong but, if there is a need for them, any attempt to ignore them or remove them can be considered just a failure.\r\n\r\nNot because the method is bad or it's not working, simply because the circular info, the one we needed and used in the first place, is lost!\r\n\r\nIn this case, `CircularJSON` does even more than just solve circular and recursions: it maps all same objects so that less memory is used as well on deserialization as less bandwidth too!\r\nIt's able to redefine those references back later on so the way we store is the way we retrieve and in a reasonably performant way, also trusting the snappy and native `JSON` methods to iterate.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
